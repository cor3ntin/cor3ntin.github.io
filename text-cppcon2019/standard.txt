Every program shall contain exactly one definition of every non-inline function or variable that is odr-used in
that program outside of a discarded statement no diagnostic required. The definition can appear
explicitly in the program, it can be found in the standard or a user-defined library, or (when appropriate) it is
implicitly defined. A definition of an inline function or variable shall be reachable in every translation unit in which it is odr-used outside of a discarded statement.
